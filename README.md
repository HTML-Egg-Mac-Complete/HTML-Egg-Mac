## Application Overview

HTML Egg Mac provides visual HTML and CSS editor with live preview capabilities through thoughtfully designed software emphasizing workflow efficiency and operational reliability within macOS environments. The application handles complex operations efficiently while maintaining smooth interface interaction through multi-threaded processing architecture that distributes computational work across available processor cores without blocking user input or interface updates.

File handling follows macOS conventions with drag-and-drop support, Quick Actions integration, version browsing through file coordination APIs, and format associations making HTML Egg the default handler for relevant document types. Recent files tracking and intelligent search capabilities quickly surface frequently accessed content, while organizational features including tags, collections, and smart folders maintain structure as project complexity grows.

Security considerations include local data processing keeping sensitive information on user machines rather than transmitting to external servers, optional encryption for stored content when required, and explicit user consent before cloud operations execute. Privacy-focused design ensures users maintain control over their data while still benefiting from optional cloud features including synchronization and backup when desired.

Accessibility support encompasses comprehensive VoiceOver integration, keyboard navigation enabling complete application operation without pointing device, adjustable interface scaling for users requiring larger text and interface elements, and high contrast modes supporting users with visual impairments. The application respects system accessibility preferences automatically adapting interface presentation when assistive technologies are active.
